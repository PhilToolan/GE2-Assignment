# GE2-Assignment
The Battle I will be recreating is the Battle of Antarctica from Stargate SG-1. Here is the scene:

Any scenes that take place in cockpits will be replaced with the camera following a random ship in the scene.
The rest of the scene will follow the scene as close to the original as possible. Most to the ships in the scene will be using pursue and evade behaviours, the final part of the 
battle will be a little bit more scripted to ensure it stays faithful to the original. When the battle moves to space, it will transition to a new scene which takes place in 
space.
